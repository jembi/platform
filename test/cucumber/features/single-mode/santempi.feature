    And The service "santedb-www" should be started with 1 replica
    And The service "santedb-mpi" should be started with 1 replica
    And The service "santedb-mpi" should be connected to the networks
      | reverse-proxy_public | mpi_public | santedb_public | santempi_default |
    And The service "santedb-www" should be connected to the networks
      | reverse-proxy_public | santempi_default |
    And There should be 3 services
    And There should be 2 volumes
