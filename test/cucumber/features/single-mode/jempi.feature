  Does the Client Registry JeMPI package work as expected

  Scenario: Init Client Registry JeMPI
    Given I use parameters "package init -n=message-bus-kafka,interoperability-layer-openhim,client-registry-jempi --only --dev --env-file=.env.local"
    When I launch the platform with params
    Then The service "mongo-1" should be started with 1 replica
    And The service "openhim-core" should be started with 1 replica
    And The service "openhim-console" should be started with 1 replica

    And The service "jempi-ratel" should be started with 1 replica
    And The service "jempi-alpha-01" should be started with 1 replica
    And The service "jempi-alpha-02" should be started with 1 replica
    And The service "jempi-alpha-03" should be started with 1 replica
    And The service "jempi-async-receiver" should be started with 1 replica
    And The service "jempi-sync-receiver" should be started with 1 replica

    And The service "jempi-api" should be started with 1 replica
    And The service "jempi-web" should be started with 1 replica

  Scenario: Destroy Client Registry JeMPI
    Given I use parameters "package destroy -n=message-bus-kafka,interoperability-layer-openhim,client-registry-jempi --dev --env-file=.env.local"
    When I launch the platform with params
